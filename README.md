# videomag-vibration-analysis
Extracts motion signals from a video for an object using code based on [The Visual Microphone](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/VisualMic/) and [Phase-based Video Motion Processing](http://people.csail.mit.edu/nwadhwa/phase-video/). A video data set is used to train a gaussian SVM classifier and a different testing set is used to test the model. The model achieved an accuracy of 70.8% against the testing set.
